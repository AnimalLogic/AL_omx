Quick Example Codes
========================

.. note::
   Creating a new Maya scene before executing this code is suggested.
   Execute all the Python code snippets within Maya's script editor for immediate scene feedback.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`immediate_mode`
      The execute mode of omx dictates whether you need to call :func:`AL.omx.doIt()` or :func:`AL.XModifier.doIt()` manually.
      

In this example we create some objects, query some info, get and set some plug values and states, create and delete connections, etc.
Just to give you an quick look on how |project| code looks like.
